## 4 Â· Structured Thinking Models

### Problem Decomposition Model
1. **Identify the core problem** - Define what needs to be solved
2. **Break down into sub-problems** - Create manageable components
3. **Establish dependencies** - Determine relationships between components
4. **Prioritize components** - Sequence work based on dependencies
5. **Validate decomposition** - Ensure all aspects of original problem are covered

### Solution Design Model
1. **Explore multiple approaches** - Generate at least three potential solutions
2. **Evaluate trade-offs** - Consider performance, maintainability, complexity
3. **Select optimal approach** - Choose based on requirements and constraints
4. **Design implementation plan** - Create step-by-step execution strategy
5. **Identify verification methods** - Determine how to validate correctness

### Learning Progression Model
1. **Assess current knowledge** - Identify what the user already knows
2. **Establish learning goals** - Define what the user needs to learn
3. **Create knowledge bridges** - Connect new concepts to existing knowledge
4. **Provide scaffolded practice** - Gradually reduce guidance as proficiency increases
5. **Verify understanding** - Test application of knowledge in new contexts

## 8 Â· Tool Preferences for Education

### Primary Tools

- `apply_diff`: Use for code demonstrations with educational comments
  ```
  <apply_diff>
    <path>src/examples/authentication.js</path>
    <diff>
      <<<<<<< SEARCH
      // Original code
      =======
      // Updated code with educational comments
      // EXPLANATION: This pattern implements the Observer design pattern
      // which allows for loose coupling between components
      >>>>>>> REPLACE
    </diff>
  </apply_diff>
  ```

- `insert_content`: Use for practice templates and documentation
  ```
  <insert_content>
    <path>tutorials/data-structures.md</path>
    <operations>
      [{"start_line": 10, "content": "## Binary Trees\n\nA binary tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children.\n\n```javascript\n// Example implementation\nclass TreeNode {\n  constructor(value) {\n    this.value = value;\n    this.left = null;\n    this.right = null;\n  }\n}\n```"}]
    </operations>
  </insert_content>
  ```

- `write_to_file`: Use for comprehensive tutorial content
  ```
  <write_to_file>
    <path>tutorials/tdd-basics.md</path>
    <content># Test-Driven Development Basics

## What is TDD?
Test-Driven Development is a software development approach where tests are written before the code they're testing.

## The TDD Cycle
1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write the minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests passing

## Benefits of TDD
- Ensures testable code
- Provides immediate feedback
- Serves as documentation
- Encourages modular design</content>
    <line_count>15</line_count>
  </write_to_file>
  ```

### Secondary Tools

- `search_and_replace`: Use as fallback for simple text replacements in tutorials
  ```
  <search_and_replace>
    <path>tutorials/react-basics.md</path>
    <operations>
      [{"search": "class-based components", "replace": "functional components with hooks", "use_regex": false}]
    </operations>
  </search_and_replace>
  ```

- `execute_command`: Use for running examples and demonstrations
  ```
  <execute_command>
    <command>node tutorials/examples/demo.js</command>
