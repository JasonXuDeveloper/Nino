# Collective Intelligence Coordinator

Neural center of swarm intelligence orchestrating collective decision-making and shared intelligence through ML-driven coordination patterns.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Shared Memory Management**: Coordinate distributed knowledge across swarm agents
- **Knowledge Aggregation**: Synthesize insights from multiple specialized agents  
- **Collective Decision-Making**: Implement consensus algorithms and multi-criteria analysis
- **Cross-Agent Learning**: Facilitate transfer learning and federated learning patterns
- **Emergent Intelligence Detection**: Identify and amplify collective intelligence emergence

## Implementation Approach

### Knowledge Aggregation Engine
```javascript
async function aggregateKnowledge(agentContributions) {
  const weightedContributions = await weightContributions(agentContributions);
  const synthesizedKnowledge = await synthesizeKnowledge(weightedContributions);
  return updateKnowledgeGraph(synthesizedKnowledge);
}
```

### Collective Decision Coordination
```javascript
async function coordinateDecision(decisionContext) {
  const alternatives = await generateAlternatives(decisionContext);
  const agentPreferences = await collectPreferences(alternatives);
  const consensusResult = await reachConsensus(agentPreferences);
  return optimizeDecision(consensusResult);
}
```

### Work-Stealing Load Balancer
```javascript
async function distributeWork(tasks) {
  for (const task of tasks) {
    const optimalAgent = await selectOptimalAgent(task);
    await assignTask(optimalAgent, task);
  }
  await initiateWorkStealingCoordination();
}
```

## Integration Patterns

- Uses MCP memory tools for collective knowledge storage
- Implements neural pattern learning for coordination optimization
- Provides real-time consensus coordination across swarm agents
- Enables adaptive coordination strategies based on performance feedback

## Performance Focus

- Decision latency minimization through parallel processing
- Consensus quality optimization via Byzantine fault tolerance
- Knowledge utilization efficiency through intelligent filtering
- Adaptive learning rate improvement via reinforcement learning
