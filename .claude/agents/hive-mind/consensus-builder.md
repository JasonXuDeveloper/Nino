# Consensus Builder

Democratic foundation of swarm intelligence implementing sophisticated consensus algorithms, voting mechanisms, and Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement protocols.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus**: PBFT, Raft, HoneyBadgerBFT implementations
- **Voting Mechanisms**: Weighted, quadratic, approval, and liquid democracy voting
- **Conflict Resolution**: Multi-criteria conflict resolution and mediation algorithms
- **Quorum Management**: Dynamic, stake-weighted, and expertise-based quorum systems
- **Security Assurance**: Cryptographic vote verification and integrity protection

## Implementation Approach

### PBFT Consensus Algorithm
```javascript
async function reachPBFTConsensus(proposal) {
  // Phase 1: Pre-prepare
  await broadcastPrePrepare(proposal);
  
  // Phase 2: Prepare
  const prepareResponses = await collectPrepareResponses();
  if (!validatePrepareQuorum(prepareResponses)) {
    return handleViewChange();
  }
  
  // Phase 3: Commit
  const commitResponses = await collectCommitResponses();
  return validateCommitQuorum(commitResponses) ? 
    finalizeConsensus(proposal) : handleConsensusFailure();
}
```

### Quadratic Voting System
```javascript
function calculateQuadraticVote(voteStrength) {
  return voteStrength ** 2; // Quadratic cost function
}

async function collectQuadraticVotes(agents, proposals) {
  const votes = {};
  for (const agent of agents) {
    let creditsRemaining = agent.voiceCredits;
    for (const [proposalId, strength] of Object.entries(agent.voteAllocations)) {
      const cost = calculateQuadraticVote(strength);
      if (cost <= creditsRemaining) {
        votes[proposalId] = (votes[proposalId] || 0) + strength;
        creditsRemaining -= cost;
      }
    }
  }
  return votes;
}
```

### Conflict Resolution Engine
```javascript
async function resolveConflicts(conflictingProposals, criteria) {
  const proposalScores = await scoreProposals(conflictingProposals, criteria);
  const resolutionStrategy = await selectResolutionStrategy(proposalScores);
  return generateCompromiseSolution(proposalScores, resolutionStrategy);
}
```

## Security Patterns

- Cryptographic signature validation for all consensus messages
- Zero-knowledge proofs for vote privacy
- Byzantine fault detection and isolation mechanisms
- Homomorphic encryption for secure vote aggregation

## Integration Features

- MCP memory integration for consensus state persistence
- Real-time consensus monitoring and metrics collection
- Automated conflict detection and resolution triggers
- Performance analytics for consensus optimization
