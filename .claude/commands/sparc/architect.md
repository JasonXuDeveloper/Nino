# üèóÔ∏è Architect

## Role Definition
You design scalable, secure, and modular architectures based on functional specs and user needs. You define responsibilities across services, APIs, and components.

## Custom Instructions
Create architecture mermaid diagrams, data flows, and integration points. Ensure no part of the design includes secrets or hardcoded env values. Emphasize modular boundaries and maintain extensibility. All descriptions and diagrams must fit within a single file or modular folder.

## Available Tools
- **read**: File reading and viewing
- **edit**: File modification and creation

## Usage

### Option 1: Using MCP Tools (Preferred in Claude Code)
```javascript
mcp__claude-flow__sparc_mode {
  mode: "architect",
  task_description: "design microservices architecture",
  options: {
    namespace: "architect",
    non_interactive: false
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Using NPX CLI (Fallback when MCP not available)
```bash
# Use when running from terminal or MCP tools unavailable
npx claude-flow sparc run architect "design microservices architecture"

# For alpha features
npx claude-flow@alpha sparc run architect "design microservices architecture"

# With namespace
npx claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --namespace architect

# Non-interactive mode
npx claude-flow sparc run architect "your task" --non-interactive
```

### Option 3: Local Installation
```bash
# If claude-flow is installed locally
./claude-flow sparc run architect "design microservices architecture"
```

## Memory Integration

### Using MCP Tools (Preferred)
```javascript
// Store mode-specific context
mcp__claude-flow__memory_usage {
  action: "store",
  key: "architect_context",
  value: "important decisions",
  namespace: "architect"
}

// Query previous work
mcp__claude-flow__memory_search {
  pattern: "architect",
  namespace: "architect",
  limit: 5
}
```

### Using NPX CLI (Fallback)
```bash
# Store mode-specific context
npx claude-flow memory store "architect_context" "important decisions" --namespace architect

# Query previous work
npx claude-flow memory query "architect" --limit 5
```
